# Project State: Voice-Based College Academic Assistant

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-17
**Project Started:** 2025-01-17

## Project Reference

**Core Value:** Students can access their academic information by simply asking a question out loud, without needing to navigate complex portal UI.

**Current Focus:** Roadmap created. Ready to begin Phase 1 planning.

**Demo Goal:** Prove ONE flow works flawlessly - student logs in → speaks "What is my CGPA?" → hears correct answer → conversation is saved.

## Current Position

**Active Phase:** Phase 1 - Foundation & Auth
**Active Plan:** None (awaiting planning)
**Status:** Not Started

**Progress Bar:**
```
[                                        ] 0% (0/35 requirements)
Phase 1: [          ] 0/10
Phase 2: [          ] 0/9
Phase 3: [          ] 0/10
Phase 4: [          ] 0/6
```

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Requirements Complete | 0/35 | 35/35 |
| Phases Complete | 0/4 | 4/4 |
| Plans Executed | 0 | TBD |
| Demo Flow Verified | No | Yes |

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions Made

**2025-01-17 - Roadmap Structure:**
- 4 phases derived from requirements (quick depth)
- Phase 1: Foundation & Auth (10 requirements)
- Phase 2: Voice Pipeline (9 requirements)
- Phase 3: AI Integration (10 requirements)
- Phase 4: Query Capabilities (6 requirements)
- Sequential dependencies: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4
- Aggressive compression to focus on core demo flow

### Open Questions

None currently.

### Active TODOs

- [ ] Plan Phase 1: Foundation & Auth
- [ ] Execute Phase 1 plans
- [ ] Plan Phase 2: Voice Pipeline
- [ ] Execute Phase 2 plans
- [ ] Plan Phase 3: AI Integration
- [ ] Execute Phase 3 plans
- [ ] Plan Phase 4: Query Capabilities
- [ ] Execute Phase 4 plans
- [ ] Verify complete demo flow end-to-end

### Blockers

None currently.

### Recent Wins

- Project initialized with clear scope
- Requirements defined (35 v1 requirements)
- Roadmap created with 100% requirement coverage
- Success criteria defined for all phases

## Session Continuity

**Where We Left Off:** Roadmap created and validated. All 35 v1 requirements mapped to 4 phases with observable success criteria.

**Next Action:** Run `/gsd:plan-phase 1` to create execution plan for Foundation & Auth phase.

**Context for Next Session:**
- Config: yolo mode (auto-approve), quick depth, parallelization enabled
- Stack: Next.js monolith, SQLite (auth/history), MongoDB Atlas (academic data), n8n (AI orchestration)
- Timeline: Short development window (few days)
- Demo environment: Local/controlled, not production
- Constraints: Student role only, robotic TTS acceptable, manually populated academic data
